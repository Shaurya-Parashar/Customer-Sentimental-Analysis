It should be a concern of all of us (Except for those who can afford it) that big companies use their logo for their defense to triple the prices of their products just because they attach their symbol to it. Look at most of the products in the video, most get some kind rating (7-10) for the seventh of the price. Imagine even so, you take the Airpods pro 2 as an example, invest more money into it and even sell each pair not for 15 dollars but 70 dollars, it will have the same features as the original ones but even better and inproved. Rememebr that everything you buy is overpriced just because it has a 10 cents logo marked on the box making it &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;Stylish&quot;."

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@Aerosklice,"France, Italy and Hungary also have similar apps, although 7 minutes is crazy, you&#39;re more around 10-20 minutes here (30+ for italy but that might just be my area). Depends on the city as well. I was a student in Paris when &quot;getir&quot; &quot;flink&quot; and something called gorilla that didn&#39;t deliver in my area where doing the grocery delivery app war, so they were all trying to be cheaper than the other. Meanwhile JustEat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats started their own grocery delivery service on top of their existing restaurant one. In Italy I mostly remember glovo, and in Hungary currently I mostly see Wolt and Foodora which are also restaurants but much more groceries than what I had seen in Paris.<br>The rise of those apps happened because of lockdown and then people were used to the convenience of it. The prices in France for the delivery and the product themselves is too high though. I was surprised that you could pay cash to the driver upon reception with JustEat in Italy, totally impossible in France."

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@joepiekl,"To be fair, you can get a pair of Nike shoes for less than $4 because that&#39;s what Nike pays to make them. I got a &#39;fake&#39; North Face jacket in Vietnam once and it lasted me 10 years. Because what they often are is excess stock from the actual factory, sometimes made on the sly with cheaper materials. But I&#39;ve also had my fair share of fake stuff that&#39;s fallen apart. Zips are often the main offenders. Don&#39;t just the shoes after the first wear. The real test will be whether they&#39;re still in one piece after a couple of months of wear."

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@BallerinChrist0,"❤Jesus Christ is the only way to be fulfilled. I&#39;m writing this as I just had an encounter with Jesus the Almighty God. I was being tempted by demonic forces. I fell into temptation, and I ran away from the Lord. This hasn&#39;t been the first time. I have been on a on and off cycle which seemed to be an endless. But today, I feel called to share this testimony. I watched a video which really opened my eyes while I was still &quot;hiding&quot; from God. It touched my soul to the point that I fell on my knees right away, and begged for forgiveness and guidance. This was beyond anyother feeling I&#39;ve felt while repenting. This one felt true. I had been like mad at God for being dumped by my this girl I was talking to. So this was a way to be tempted by evil demonic forces. I would get intrusive thoughts, and I kept trying to solve this feeling of being dumped on worldly things. And let me tell you, it only makes it worse. If you&#39;re someone who is not sure if you&#39;re saved, or if you are saved, but have been going through these on and off cycles such as porn, or secular music(which are other cycles I&#39;ve been having a difficult time with) I want you to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life. If you don&#39;t know what to do, I want you to get on your knees, and pray this prayer with your heart: <br>Jesus, I believe you died on the cross for my sins, and was ressurected on the third day. I believe you came to the Earth, to pay for our sins. Thank you for dieing on the cross for my sins, in Your Name, I pray, amen.<br>  I don&#39;t know who is reading this, but if you ever fill an empty whole, which cannot be fulfilled, the only way to fulfill is by Jesus. When you turn your back on Jesus, you seek everything other then him. All worldly things, will never fill that hole.<br>God Bless Yall!<br>❤"

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@taotao98103,"It&#39;s fun to watch this. Actually I think the reason with the price gap has to do with the research and development cost and the massive margin that Apple and other major companies are charging. When you copy someone, you don&#39;t have to go through the time and money on creating a new product in the first place. If there&#39;s no intellectual property, when all the major companies died out due to lack of sales to the piracy, there will be no more products to copy from. It is like killing the goose that lay golden eggs."

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@Ray_Kaminari,"The thing is , what differentiates a &quot;not-so-expensive&quot; product from a real expensive one is the factor of &quot;luxury&quot;, the extra features which some hardcore tech users or some minority of rich individuals would want for their product is what usually makes those products so expensive, this isn&#39;t just a tech thing, and not just in the cane of features of a product but  usually the price is due to the brand and even with lots of other companies that can make products just as good they won&#39;t be half as expensive or else they wouldn&#39;t be able to compete either, and since they are cheap they can stay relevant, i think this is basically the game when it comes to shoes in Asia.<br>So the range of price difference is basically the what separates necessity and luxury.

Ignorance does not protect one from punishment as it is in nearly every country. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t encourage such talking and praising obvious scams and make people think that these scam products might be worth it. If you try buy anything like this on the internet, you will be disappointed, a lot. <br><br>Don&#39;t fall for it, if you can spend it. You should. As you do not just pay for construction and parts cost but also a lot in researching and protecting measurements (and sure Marketing too but imagine how expensive it is to do all the research and development on something like improving a camera.

It seems most things are very simple to access through smartphones. These devices have really changed the world for the better in many cases. For example, in my particular situation, I can do things we all can, stream, order from Amazon, etc. but I can also do things specifically for accessibility. Read books from the library of Congress’ digital library not audiobooks free to blind or other print disabled people, identify colors I cannot distinguish between since I have some useable residual visual , identification of paper currency, read labels, or mail… or I could if I could hold the paper still. Packages are easier it seems. They have made tools that cost so much because of a limited market accessible to everyone who needs them. Even on lower end devices.

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@gouthamkrishna7574,"The Samsung Galaxy M34 is the phone that I use. Yes it had those ads when I started up the device...but aaaaaall of it can be turned off and the lock screen thing is called glance. You can switch that off too. One of the best thing about the phone is that you get proper One UI with it. Not Core One UI. I think the only One UI spec that it lacks is the Dex feature. You get Samsung Knox security, Secure folder and many more features of those high end Samsung phones. 120 Hz refresh rate AMOLED, has ANC and a lot more. Now considering it as a ₹16,000 phone...ie a $195 phone...that&#39;s not bad if you ask me. I mean all those extra apps can be uninstalled and they won&#39;t come back again. It doesn&#39;t support goodlock, but does support finelock...which is almost the same thing..."

You have to let the dough soak in hot water for 10 mins and not add any oil until you&#39;ve made it like a ball. If its sticks, you just add 1-2 drops of oil at the end and done. When placing inside the roti maker, make sure to coat it with the layer of the same flour, just like rolling it, and flatten it with your palms. <br>Place it in at the very centre and press the lid until you start to hear a squeaking sound. if you hear more of these, it rips the roti and it wont puff up. Give it a few turns, and when you feel its half-cooked evenly, let the lid on the roti for 5-10 seconds. It puffs up and comes out like a PS4 disk all by itself. Try it, you&#39;ll love it. <br><br>Much love &lt;3"

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@BearClaws94258,"Now, while this might not be what the video was about, this is here because it is eternally important: Death will not be the end of anyone&#39;s existing. To have eternal life, to escape hell, do not to try to become religious or to reform yourself morally. It&#39;s like offering a bribe to God to clear you of your bad deeds, because a good work will not clear bad deeds, like in any court. Hell is very real, and it is eternal darkness, separation and torment. If you&#39;ve lied, stolen anything, such as music online, or used God&#39;s name as a cussword, you stand as a liar, thief and blasphemer just from only 3 commandments. The Bible says in the book of Romans that the wages of sin is death. Though we may like to trivialize what we do, each and every evil action, evil though, and evil intent of the heart is deadly serious to God, evident through that we are all headed towards death.<br><br>Now, most people know Jesus died on the cross almost 2,000 years ago, but many might not understand that what happened was that while we broke God&#39;s moral law, He paid for our fine of death. He cried out &quot;It is finished&quot; just before He died, meaning that our punishment had been paid. In any court, if your fine is paid, you can be given mercy. So it is with God. Jesus rose from the dead 3 days later, and all that you have to do to have eternal life and to be saved from hell is that while you Should confess sins to God and turn from them (repent), the only thing that can actually save you is to trust Alone in Jesus and what He did for you on the cross. If you have faith, you will be saved from hell, that simply. So repent and trust alone in Jesus like you trust a parachute to save your life, and because of what He did, you will be saved.<br><br> Hell is very real, and it is eternal darkness, separation and torment. If you do not believe, you are condemned already because of your multitude of acts against God, who lavished His goodness and kindness upon you in giving you life and every good thing, as is described in the Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 18 (for reference). Being saved is not by joining a religion or trying to earn it, but just turning to God and having faith as a child, that simply, but there is no neutral ground. As Jesus said, you are either with Him or against Him, you either gather with Him or scatter abroad. Unlike the many gods of stone, wood, gold, bronze, or even pixels on a screen, Jesus is true and alive and has made it clear also through all of the prophecy fulfilled in the world, such as Israel being cast out of their land, taking Jerusalem back, becoming a nation again in a day and being immediately attacked from all sides too, all things prophesied ranging from 2,000 years and earlier from before they happened. You do not know when you will die, so consider this and decide with the same seriousness as if you were in your last hours of life, lest death seize upon you with no hope! Don&#39;t throw your eternity away for a few short pleasures!"

I bought the CHEAPEST Tech in India!,@venkiemama,I wouldn&#39;t actually comment on videos but I noticed few points that Arun did wrong by mistake as he is unaware of the situation<br>1. Rotis would puff up if he had closed the lid and let the roti fry a bit<br>2. The gaming console comes with a generic branded sd card where the built in games are loaded<br>3. While setting up your samsung phone. Samsung actually smartly hides few options where you can opt out of getting ads on it. But the general public wouldn&#39;t know how to uncheck the options so you can get rid of the ads. That&#39;s a smart way manufacturers make some money by selling phone at a cheaper price and earn money with ads. Again as Arun mentioned <b>JUGAAD</b> <br><br>These points doesn&#39;t make this a mis-informed video but it was his genuine lack of Knowledge as how things work here. This is an awesome video it shows how advanced we Indians are with the payment situation and with apps like blinkit and UrbanCompany

For example, you will never find someone using their phone or computer in the Hindi language (even though devices and apps support it), and I feel like it&#39;s a shame. I see Germans or Russians using their own native language, and I know how to speak Hindi; I do talk in Hindi with all my friends and family but unfortunately, I don&#39;t know how to read and write hindi. It&#39;s not the case for everyone, but for young people like me, it is.<br><br>Also, I feel like that game controller was manufactured in China and is just sold here, so there&#39;s no way it would have Hindi."
