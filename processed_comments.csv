Meanwhile JustEat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats started their own grocery delivery service on top of their existing restaurant one. In Italy I mostly remember glovo, and in Hungary currently I mostly see Wolt and Foodora which are also restaurants but much more groceries than what I had seen in Paris.<br>The rise of those apps happened because of lockdown and then people were used to the convenience of it.

@BallerinChrist0,"❤Jesus Christ is the only way to be fulfilled. I&#39;m writing this as I just had an encounter with Jesus the Almighty God. I was being tempted by demonic forces. I fell into temptation, and I ran away from the Lord. This hasn&#39;t been the first time. I have been on a on and off cycle which seemed to be an endless. But today, I feel called to share this testimony. I watched a video which really opened my eyes while I was still &quot;hiding&quot; from God. It touched my soul to the point that I fell on my knees right away, and begged for forgiveness and guidance. This was beyond anyother feeling I&#39;ve felt while repenting. This one felt true. I had been like mad at God for being dumped by my this girl I was talking to. So this was a way to be tempted by evil demonic forces. I would get intrusive thoughts, and I kept trying to solve this feeling of being dumped on worldly things. And let me tell you, it only makes it worse. If you&#39;re someone who is not sure if you&#39;re saved, or if you are saved, but have been going through these on and off cycles such as porn, or secular music(which are other cycles I&#39;ve been having a difficult time with) I want you to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life. If you don&#39;t know what to do, I want you to get on your knees, and pray this prayer with your heart: <br>Jesus, I believe you died on the cross for my sins, and was ressurected on the third day. I believe you came to the Earth, to pay for our sins. Thank you for dieing on the cross for my sins, in Your Name, I pray, amen.<br>  I don&#39;t know who is reading this, but if you ever fill an empty whole, which cannot be fulfilled, the only way to fulfill is by Jesus. When you turn your back on Jesus, you seek everything other then him. All worldly things, will never fill that hole.<br>God Bless Yall!<br>❤",JesusChrististheonlywaytobefulfilledI39mwritingthisasIjusthadanencounterwithJesustheAlmightyGodIwasbeingtemptedbydemonicforcesIfellintotemptationandIranawayfromtheLordThishasn39tbeenthefirsttimeIhavebeenonaonandoffcyclewhichseemedtobeanendlessButtodayIfeelcalledtosharethistestimonyIwatchedavideowhichreallyopenedmyeyeswhileIwasstillquothidingquotfromGodIttouchedmysoultothepointthatIfellonmykneesrightawayandbeggedforforgivenessandguidanceThiswasbeyondanyotherfeelingI39vefeltwhilerepentingThisonefelttrueIhadbeenlikemadatGodforbeingdumpedbymythisgirlIwastalkingtoSothiswasawaytobetemptedbyevildemonicforcesIwouldgetintrusivethoughtsandIkepttryingtosolvethisfeelingofbeingdumpedonworldlythingsAndletmetellyouitonlymakesitworseIfyou39resomeonewhoisnotsureifyou39resavedorifyouaresavedbuthavebeengoingthroughtheseonandoffcyclessuchaspornorsecularmusicwhichareothercyclesI39vebeenhavingadifficulttimewithIwantyoutocalluponthenameoftheLordJesusChristHeisthewaythetruthandthelifeIfyoudon39tknowwhattodoIwantyoutogetonyourkneesandpraythisprayerwithyourheartJesusIbelieveyoudiedonthecrossformysinsandwasressurectedonthethirddayIbelieveyoucametotheEarthtopayforoursinsThankyoufordieingonthecrossformysinsinYourNameIprayamenIdon39tknowwhoisreadingthisbutifyoueverfillanemptywholewhichcannotbefulfilledtheonlywaytofulfillisbyJesusWhenyouturnyourbackonJesusyouseekeverythingotherthenhimAllworldlythingswillneverfillthatholeGodBlessYall,neutral

@coffeecat086,"As a legally blind person, the way everything is done over there is so interesting! It seems most things are very simple to access through smartphones. These devices have really changed the world for the better in many cases. For example, in my particular situation, I can do things we all can, stream, order from Amazon, etc. but I can also do things specifically for accessibility.

@SanthoshSekar95,"Hey Arun &lt;3<br>The Roti maker you use, it puffs up like you expect. You have to let the dough soak in hot water for 10 mins and not add any oil until you&#39;ve made it like a ball. If its sticks, you just add 1-2 drops of oil at the end and done. When placing inside the roti maker, make sure to coat it with the layer of the same flour, just like rolling it, and flatten it with your palms. <br>Place it in at the very centre and press the lid until you start to hear a squeaking sound. if you hear more of these, it rips the roti and it wont puff up. Give it a few turns, and when you feel its half-cooked evenly, let the lid on the roti for 5-10 seconds. It puffs up and comes out like a PS4 disk all by itself.

@BearClaws94258,"Now, while this might not be what the video was about, this is here because it is eternally important: Death will not be the end of anyone&#39;s existing. To have eternal life, to escape hell, do not to try to become religious or to reform yourself morally. It&#39;s like offering a bribe to God to clear you of your bad deeds, because a good work will not clear bad deeds, like in any court. Hell is very real, and it is eternal darkness, separation and torment. If you&#39;ve lied, stolen anything, such as music online, or used God&#39;s name as a cussword, you stand as a liar, thief and blasphemer just from only 3 commandments. The Bible says in the book of Romans that the wages of sin is death. Though we may like to trivialize what we do, each and every evil action, evil though, and evil intent of the heart is deadly serious to God, evident through that we are all headed towards death.<br><br>Now, most people know Jesus died on the cross almost 2,000 years ago, but many might not understand that what happened was that while we broke God&#39;s moral law, He paid for our fine of death. He cried out &quot;It is finished&quot; just before He died, meaning that our punishment had been paid. In any court, if your fine is paid, you can be given mercy. So it is with God. Jesus rose from the dead 3 days later, and all that you have to do to have eternal life and to be saved from hell is that while you Should confess sins to God and turn from them (repent), the only thing that can actually save you is to trust Alone in Jesus and what He did for you on the cross. If you have faith, you will be saved from hell, that simply. So repent and trust alone in Jesus like you trust a parachute to save your life, and because of what He did, you will be saved.<br><br> Hell is very real, and it is eternal darkness, separation and torment. If you do not believe, you are condemned already because of your multitude of acts against God, who lavished His goodness and kindness upon you in giving you life and every good thing, as is described in the Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 18 (for reference). Being saved is not by joining a religion or trying to earn it, but just turning to God and having faith as a child, that simply, but there is no neutral ground. As Jesus said, you are either with Him or against Him, you either gather with Him or scatter abroad. Unlike the many gods of stone, wood, gold, bronze, or even pixels on a screen, Jesus is true and alive and has made it clear also through all of the prophecy fulfilled in the world, such as Israel being cast out of their land, taking Jerusalem back, becoming a nation again in a day and being immediately attacked from all sides too, all things prophesied ranging from 2,000 years and earlier from before they happened. You do not know when you will die, so consider this and decide with the same seriousness as if you were in your last hours of life, lest death seize upon you with no hope! Don&#39;t throw your eternity away for a few short pleasures!",NowwhilethismightnotbewhatthevideowasaboutthisisherebecauseitiseternallyimportantDeathwillnotbetheendofanyone39sexistingTohaveeternallifetoescapehelldonottotrytobecomereligiousortoreformyourselfmorallyIt39slikeofferingabribetoGodtoclearyouofyourbaddeedsbecauseagoodworkwillnotclearbaddeedslikeinanycourtHellisveryrealanditiseternaldarknessseparationandtormentIfyou39veliedstolenanythingsuchasmusiconlineorusedGod39snameasacusswordyoustandasaliarthiefandblasphemerjustfromonly3commandmentsTheBiblesaysinthebookofRomansthatthewagesofsinisdeathThoughwemayliketotrivializewhatwedoeachandeveryevilactionevilthoughandevilintentoftheheartisdeadlyserioustoGodevidentthroughthatweareallheadedtowardsdeathNowmostpeopleknowJesusdiedonthecrossalmost2000yearsagobutmanymightnotunderstandthatwhathappenedwasthatwhilewebrokeGod39smorallawHepaidforourfineofdeathHecriedoutquotItisfinishedquotjustbeforeHediedmeaningthatourpunishmenthadbeenpaidInanycourtifyourfineispaidyoucanbegivenmercySoitiswithGodJesusrosefromthedead3dayslaterandallthatyouhavetodotohaveeternallifeandtobesavedfromhellisthatwhileyouShouldconfesssinstoGodandturnfromthemrepenttheonlythingthatcanactuallysaveyouistotrustAloneinJesusandwhatHedidforyouonthecrossIfyouhavefaithyouwillbesavedfromhellthatsimplySorepentandtrustaloneinJesuslikeyoutrustaparachutetosaveyourlifeandbecauseofwhatHedidyouwillbesavedHellisveryrealanditiseternaldarknessseparationandtormentIfyoudonotbelieveyouarecondemnedalreadybecauseofyourmultitudeofactsagainstGodwholavishedHisgoodnessandkindnessuponyouingivingyoulifeandeverygoodthingasisdescribedintheGospelofJohnchapter3verse18forreferenceBeingsavedisnotbyjoiningareligionortryingtoearnitbutjustturningtoGodandhavingfaithasachildthatsimplybutthereisnoneutralgroundAsJesussaidyouareeitherwithHimoragainstHimyoueithergatherwithHimorscatterabroadUnlikethemanygodsofstonewoodgoldbronzeorevenpixelsonascreenJesusistrueandaliveandhasmadeitclearalsothroughalloftheprophecyfulfilledintheworldsuchasIsraelbeingcastoutoftheirlandtakingJerusalembackbecominganationagaininadayandbeingimmediatelyattackedfromallsidestooallthingsprophesiedrangingfrom2000yearsandearlierfrombeforetheyhappenedYoudonotknowwhenyouwilldiesoconsiderthisanddecidewiththesameseriousnessasifyouwereinyourlasthoursoflifelestdeathseizeuponyouwithnohopeDon39tthrowyoureternityawayforafewshortpleasures,neutral

@venkiemama,I wouldn&#39;t actually comment on videos but I noticed few points that Arun did wrong by mistake as he is unaware of the situation<br>1. Rotis would puff up if he had closed the lid and let the roti fry a bit<br>2. The gaming console comes with a generic branded sd card where the built in games are loaded<br>3. While setting up your samsung phone. Samsung actually smartly hides few options where you can opt out of getting ads on it. But the general public wouldn&#39;t know how to uncheck the options so you can get rid of the ads. That&#39;s a smart way manufacturers make some money by selling phone at a cheaper price and earn money with ads. Again as Arun mentioned <b>JUGAAD</b> <br><br>These points doesn&#39;t make this a mis-informed video but it was his genuine lack of Knowledge as how things work here. This is an awesome video it shows how advanced we Indians are with the payment situation and with apps like blinkit and UrbanCompany,Iwouldn39tactuallycommentonvideosbutInoticedfewpointsthatArundidwrongbymistakeasheisunawareofthesituation1Rotiswouldpuffupifhehadclosedthelidandlettherotifryabit2Thegamingconsolecomeswithagenericbrandedsdcardwherethebuiltingamesareloaded3WhilesettingupyoursamsungphoneSamsungactuallysmartlyhidesfewoptionswhereyoucanoptoutofgettingadsonitButthegeneralpublicwouldn39tknowhowtounchecktheoptionssoyoucangetridoftheadsThat39sasmartwaymanufacturersmakesomemoneybysellingphoneatacheaperpriceandearnmoneywithadsAgainasArunmentionedJUGAADThesepointsdoesn39tmakethisamisinformedvideobutitwashisgenuinelackofKnowledgeashowthingsworkhereThisisanawesomevideoitshowshowadvancedweIndiansarewiththepaymentsituationandwithappslikeblinkitandUrbanCompany,neutral
